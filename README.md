Our group utilized R, Shiny, and Python to examine influences on student engaement in statistics. Our team leveraged R, Shiny, and Python to analyze factors influencing student engagement in statistics. We then proposed actionable solutions to enhance the learning experience on CourseKata, an interactive online textbook designed for teaching introductory statistics and data science.

We built an interactive **Shiny dashboard** to visualize student engagement levels within each chapter of the three distinct textbooks. Additionally, we created a second dashboard that tracks each student’s engagement trends over time, allowing for a direct comparison between their engagement levels and their end-of-course (EOC) score trends.

Next, we implemented a **multiple linear regression model** that predicts a student’s average EOC score based on their total engagement time with the CourseKata textbooks, alongside their average reported Intrinsic and Utility values. This was done to test the hypothesis that a student’s engagement with statistics is correlated with their intrinsic interest and the perceived practical utility of the course content.

Lastly, we designed **visualizations** to showcase key insights, including total engagement time trends across all chapters for the three textbooks, and the frequency distribution of question types within each chapter.
